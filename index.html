        <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Eddie Yoshie, a Combined Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate at the University of British Columbia. 
            I’m passionate about technology and excited to share my journey and work with you. This portfolio showcases my projects, 
            skills, and experiences as I continue to learn and grow in the field of technology.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: left;">

            <p style="margin-right: 20px;">My name is Eddie Yoshie, and I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in combined mathematics and computer science at the University of British Columbia. With a strong foundation in programming and a passion for software engineering, web development, and game development, I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.<br><br>
        
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on various projects, including my CookieJar Cookbook App and BunnyChomp web game. These experiences have honed my skills in implementing code systematically, creating comprehensive tests, and debugging efficiently. I am excited about exploring opportunities in software engineering, web development, and game development.<br><br>
        
            When I’m not studying or working on projects, I enjoy cooking Japanese home-style cuisine, working out using a PPL split, and playing Minecraft with my friends. I’m always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.<br><br>
            
            Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see some of my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate.</p>
